# Simple-Information-Retrieval-System
This project aims to build a simple information retrieval system. It includes text processing techniques such as tokenization, stop words removal, lemmatization, and converting text to lowercase to preprocess the text data. The processed data is then used to implement and test the retrieval system.
## Features
Tokenization: Splits text into individual tokens (words).
Stop Words Removal: Filters out common stop words that do not contribute to meaningful analysis.
Punctuation Removal: Removes punctuation marks from the text.
Lemmatization: Reduces words to their base or root form.
Lowercasing: Converts all characters in the text to lowercase for uniformity.
Testing: Includes testing procedures to verify the correctness of the text processing pipeline.
Visualization: Provides visual representation of the processed text data.
